# django_music_app

This web application was created with Django and React. It is a music sharing app with connections through spotify API's. The funtions of this application is to allow groups of people to enter a room where music is selected and played by the room owner. All perticipants in the room are able to vote to skip the song or pause the song depending on if they like it or not. This is type of application my be especially ego draining to me as any of my friends dislike my playlist, meaning most of my songs will be voted on to skip.
